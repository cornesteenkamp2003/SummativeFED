                        <h2>PAMELA'S EARLY LIFE</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p class="justified">
                            Pamela Reif was someone who enjoyed dance, sports, and other extracurricular activities growing up. She said; “I have always been into sports, previously as a dancer.” However, by the time she turned 16, Pamela lost interest in some of these activities. In a search for something new, she decided to start going to the gym with her friend. “When I turned 16 I decided to stop dancing and to start going to the gym instead. I went with a friend of mine and we had basically no plan.” Initially, Pamela didn’t know anything about training in the gym. Because of this, she asked a person who worked at her gym to show her how to train. Unfortunately, Pamela didn’t get the training plan she’d hoped for – saying; “This plan was just a standard plan they gave to everyone and not what worked for me.” The plan Pamela was following consisted of countless cardio sessions, along with some light weightlifting and group training classes. After weeks of training like this, Pamela saw no changes in her physique. In fact, she only lost more weight on her already slim frame. As she said; “during this time my body got very lean, my body fat percentage was pretty low too, my abs were strong & visible but I was extremely skinny. I weighed about 45kg.” Having seen little to no results from cardio, Pamela eventually decided to change her training completely. Instead of running on a treadmill, she incorporated more weightlifting into her routine – consisting of squats, deadlifts, and other compound exercises. “Eventually, I got interested in weightlifting. Not because I felt uncomfortable with my body but because I was interested in what the boys in the gym are doing with those big weights haha. It looked so much more fun than a treadmill.” Combined with her nutrient-rich diet, Pamela’s new training program saw her physique improve dramatically. Her arms became toned, her legs and glutes firmer, and her midsection became more ripped than ever. After seeing the results, Pamela became intrigued with the fitness lifestyle. In fact, what started as just a hobby, soon turned into a career on the rise.

                        <h2>PAMELA'S RISE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND HER DIET</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p class="justified">
                            While on her fitness journey, Pamela opened her internet pages where she shared her fit photos and videos. Unexpectedly, she started attracting a large number of people to her sites. “I started posting pictures and I had absolutely no idea that social media could get me somewhere in life.” Pamela’s followers became intrigued by her physique, as well as her fitness story. This is where Pamela realized she could make an impact on people’s lives, along with building a healthy career on the internet. She began sharing photos and videos of her lifestyle every day, slowly growing a community of followers on her social media sites. Over the years, Pamela’s diet has changed drastically. While she always focused on eating healthy foods, Pamela didn’t consume enough calories during the early stages of her fitness journey. Because of this, her progress in the gym suffered. Once she added calorie-dense foods to her diet, Pamela saw the biggest changes in her physique. She said; “I started eating a lot of healthy food and got more knowledge about a proper nutrition, macronutrients, calories and of course I learned how to cook healthy and delicious meals. Lots of people also think that a healthy lifestyle means that you need to forgo everything. But I learned that you need to concentrate on eating more of the right food instead of concentrating on what you shouldn’t eat. So in fact, you’re eating more, not less.” – Pamela Reif
                            Pamela Reif has shown us how training and diet go hand in hand when it comes to reaching your fitness goals. Initially, Pamela didn’t follow the correct training and nutrition plan. Because of this, her results in the gym stagnated. It wasn’t until she incorporated serious weight training into her routine, along with adding more calories to her diet, when her physique improved the most. If there’s one lesson to be learned from Pamela, it’s to focus on all aspects of your fitness journey, not just one.
